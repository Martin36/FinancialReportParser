# FinancialReportParser

This repo contains code for some experiments that I have done in order to try to extract relevant information from financial reports. 

### Motivation

Say that you want to know the earnings from Apple's latest quarterly report. But you live a busy life so you don't have time to read through the whole report in order to aquire the information.
This is where this algorithm magically appears and makes your life easier. Instead of reading through the whole report all you have to do is to ask the algorithm for the earnings from Apple's latest report and it will find this for you.

Now this is far from complete, but that is the idea behind it.
